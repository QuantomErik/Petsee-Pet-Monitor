**Sprint backlog v5**
**Analys av föregående iteration.**
This week I mainly focused on deploying my application for production. I first tried using Netlify for deployment but realized that they don't provide an actual back-end server to use. So I chose to use the ubuntu server that the school is providing for us. All in all it took much longer than I expected to deploy my application and for the functions to work properly. I had to restructure alot of code, mainly routes and urls and ofcourse the fetch end-points so that it points to the remote server. That is why this week I only added one additional function to the application, which is the To-do list.
