**Sprint backlog v4**
**Analys av föregående iteration.**
This week we had the oral examination on the course and so I spent some time studying for that. A part from that, my goal was to continue finetuning the functions of the application. I realized that adding a dock, that would be visible to the logged in user at all times, would increase the user experience. So this week I put alot of focus on adding the dock, adding functions to the dock, such as, adding pets, displaying the user's different pets, adding buttons for customer service, faq, and a log out button. I also worked alot on implementation of the user being able to switch between pets. This way, all the saved data/information are specifically tied to a certain pet, and the user can switch between pets to show that specific pet's information. So far I have managed to implement this for the Dietdetails function.
