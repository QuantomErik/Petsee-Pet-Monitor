**Sprint backlog v7**
**Analys av föregående iteration.**
For this week I spent most of my time developing automated unit and acceptance (end to end) tests for my application. The unit tests were a bit easier to formulate and to run succesfully than the end to end tests, but I still feel that I wanted to implement more tests generally. I managed to create three succesfull test suites for unit tests and three sucessfull test suites for end to end tests. I tried implemening alot more automated tests but they did not run correctly. I also implemented CD/CI pipelines in Gitlab. It took alot of debugging of the .yml file as well as on my own test code but in the end I got it to work smoothly through all stages: build, test, review and production. I also spent alot of time finished the documentaction for my project. For the next and final week I will continue working on the documentation, as well as prepare to record the demonstration film.
