# Test Feedback from users

## User1

### Issues

1. When trying to add a new pet without filling in all the input fields, the user left the input fields for "medical notes" and "favorite toy" on two seperate occations, and try to save the pet, nothing was happening. The user recommended some kind of user promt or message to convey a message/indication to the application user that it is mandatory to fill in all the input fields. For example that the empty input fields turns red.
2. When clicking on the "Pet App" text in the top left corner, the user is redirected to  https://cscloud7-95.lnu.se/home instead of https://cscloud7-95.lnu.se/petsee/home, which would not work.

### Positives
- Most of the functions are working and the user interface looks good. The application looks professional and tidy. 

## User2

### Issues
1. Same as the previous user.
2. When trying to add a new pet but leaving some input field empty, nothing happens when clicking the add pet button. After refreshing the page the user got {"error":"Not Found","status":404,"path":"/more/addpet"}.

### Positives
- The logic for registration and login works correctly.
